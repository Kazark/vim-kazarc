This is my personal Vim initialization plugin; I haven't been trying to build it
in a highly configurable way. Rather, it is my configuration. Still, feel free
to give it a try.

This is a work in progress; I do not considered to be in a mature or even stable
state.

My hope in the end is to support multiple operating systems (particularly Linux
and Windows) and multiple terminals and console emulators within that
environment, as well as a variety of sets of plugins, etc.
