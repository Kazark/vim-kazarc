My personal Vim initialization plugin. This is a work in progress; I do not
considered to be in a mature or even stable state.

My hope in the end is to support multiple operating systems (particularly Linux
and Windows) and multiple terminals and console emulators within that
environment, as well as a variety of sets of plugins, etc. So far, it is just
patched together.
