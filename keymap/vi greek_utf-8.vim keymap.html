<h2> 
<a name="d1e49">1. Traditional Greek Keyboard Layout</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The mapping used in the "greek_utf-8" keymap 
supplied with vim perplexed me at first, 
but that was only because of my own ignorance. 
For example, I would have used the "w" character for lowercase omega, 
as it looks a bit like a lowercase omega; 
this keyboard mapping uses "v" (and uses "w" for final sigma). 
It turns out, of course, that the mapping used in this keymap 
is simply that of the traditional Greek keyboard layout 
(for modern monotonic and polytonic Greek?) 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>Here is an illustration of such a Greek keyboard layout, 
from the 


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia (EN)</a> 
article on 
" 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout">Keyboard layout</a>."

<p>Traditional Greek Keyboard Layout</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>What is interesting in this keyboard mapping is simply the 
position of several alphabetic keys vis-a-vis a US ASCII keyboard: 

</p> 

<ul> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>final sigma (ς) at lowercase w</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>theta (θ/Θ) at u/U</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>xi (ξ/Ξ) at j/J</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>psi (ψ/Ψ) at c/C</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>omga (ω/Ω) at v</li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>A number of other comments may be made concerning this keyboard image 
relative to the mapping in the greek_utf-8 keymap, 
and of course I'll make them, 
but they may be irrelevant. 
I have no idea how representative the keyboard shown above is 
(keyboards differ, and even 
my own QWERTY keyboard differs from it in the placement 
of some non-Greek symbols). 
It might be best simply to 
skip to the next section, 
which concerns the greek_utf-8 mapping itself. 
In any event: 
</p> 

<ul> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Number row: 
Characters shown on the lower right of the keys are not present 
in greek_utf-8 
(superscript numerals, plus/minus sign, one-half sign) 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Top letter row: 
The colon shown (where a Q is in a US keyboard) 
maps to an ASCII colon in greek_utf-8 
(This might indeed be an ASCII colon in modern Greek; 
it is not an ancient Greek "ano teleia" 
(middle-dot; U+0387 (·), which is the ancient colon/semicolon.)) 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Top letter row: 
The shifted third-letter-over shown 
(where the W is on a US keyboard) 
may be a dialytika/diaeresis with an additional accent 
(it's hard for me to read it in this image). 
It maps to "ano teleia" in greek_utf-8 
(middle-dot; U+-387 (·); which is the ancient colon/semicolon). 
(The greek_utf-8 keymap 
comments that this is from the Emacs text editor's conventions. 
It is also enterable as ";." (semicolon period); see below). 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Top letter row: 
The left and right pointed double quotation marks shown here are not present 
in greek_utf-8 
(they are enterable as "&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;"; see the greek_utf-8 keymap file). 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Middle letter row: 
The character shown in the lower-right of the acute/dialytika/diaeresis key 
(the colon/semicolon key in a US ASCII keyboard) 
may be a dialytika/diaeresis with an additionl accent. 
As such it isn't mapped in greek_utf-8. 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>vertical-bar/backslash key (my keyboard has this in a different place): 
the greek_utf-8 vertical bar is used for precomposed iota subscript; 
with a pause after, it becomes just a vertical bar.

Whether the circumflex displays looking like a tilde or

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>Note that the necessarily short vowels ε and ο cannot take

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The circumflex accent is also called the

by characters called "tilde" (though I don't believe it should 
be written as a tilde, but this is another issue) 
and "inverted breve."

</ul> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>This produces precomposed Unicode characters such as 
(in the first example above) 
U+1FBC "GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI." 
How this precomposed character is rendered depends on what is 
doing the rendering. 
The Unicode 4.1.0 chart, the glyphs for which are non-normative, 
shows it as an Α with a tiny iota to the right. 
Whatever font is being used with vim 6.3 as I type this shows it 
with a subscript iota. 
Whatever font is being used with Mozilla 1.7.11 as I view this 
(it's not clear which font this is), does the same. 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>To force the display of "ΑΙ" 
(an adscript Iota done as a full-sized capital on the lettering baseline) 
you'd have to type "ΑΙ". 
This would, of course, be encoded as U+0391 U+0399, 
not as a single precomposed character. 
This could affect such things as searching and typographic processing. 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The iota subscript is also called the 
"prosgegrammeni."

The vim greek_utf-8 keymap maps specific sequences of 
typed keystrokes to particular Unicode characters. 
The order in which they're typed thus does make a difference. 
This is true both for simple diacritical marks 
(e.g., type the accent before the character to be accented, 
or the iota-subscript indicator after) 
and for stacked-up diacritical marks 
(e.g., greater-than + semicolon + a gives an acute accented alpha with a 
smooth breathing mark (ἄ, U+1F04), 
while semicolon + greater-than + a gives a 
right-double-pointy-quote followed by an unaccented alpha 
(U+00bb U+03B1). 
</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a> 
Typing the diacritical mark (e.g., the semicolon for acute accent) 
followed by a sufficient pause 
or followed by a character with which it cannot compose 
will result in the diacritical mark itself. 
(Exeption: iota subscript (type the vertical bar twice: || gives ͺ); 
it is not possible to do an iota adscript by itself.) 

</p> 

<p>

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The Unicode 4.1.0 standard calls

but prefers the "middle dot" character U+00B7 from the range 
U+0080 to U+00FF, "C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement" ("Latin-1 Punctuation"). 
The greek_utf-8 encoding calls it "GREEK ANO TELEIA"

";." (following the KDE methods) or "W" (following Emacs, 
but also the Greek keyboard as illustrated above). 
</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>However, greek_utf-8 also calls U+003A (an ASCII colon) 
"GREEK EPEXIGIMATIKA OR ANO &amp; KATO TELEIA - DEFINITION MISSING FROM UNICODE" 
(and indeed there is no "epexigimatika or kato teleia in Unicode 4.1.0). 
It allows this to be typed as a capital Q,

<h2> 
<a name="d1e319">2.7. Common Diacritical Marks as Combining Character Sequences</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>To do this we need to enter Greek characters from the ordinary 
"Greek and Coptic" range (U+0370 to U+03FF) 
together with diacritical marks from the "Combining Diacritical Marks" range 
(U+0300 to U+036F). 
Unfortunately, these latter are not mapped in greek_utf-8. 
To use them in it 
means that we need first to enter the ordinary letter as discussed above, 
and then to enter the diacritical mark or marks using the 
"CNTRL-V u XXXX" method. 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>For example, to insert an alpha with an acute accent, I'd do: 
</p> 

<pre> 
i&lt;F2&gt;a&lt;CNTL-v&gt;u0301&lt;Esc&gt; 

</pre> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>That is: 
</p> 

<ul> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press "i" to get into vi insert mode.</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press the &lt;F2&gt; key to start up the greek_utf-8 keymap 
(as set up in my $HOME/.vimrc file). 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press "a" to enter the lowercase alpha.</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press the "CONTROL v" key pair.</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press "u" to indicate that the input will be 4 hex digits (u = unicode).</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>type 0301 to indicate U+0301, "COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT".</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>press the "Escape" key to exit vi insert mode.</li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>A pause of indefinite length may occur between the letter and 
the diacritical mark. 
Indeed, one can at this point exit insert mode, 
do something else, come back, 
and still have the successive characters appear combined. 
(They are, after all, simply successive characters underneath; 
the combining is merely a matter of presentation graphics.) 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>I have created a modified version of this keymap

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>which includes these combining characters. 
</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The Unicode standard 
allows any sequence of characters 
but also indicates that when multiple combining diacritical 
marks can interact with each other typographically that 
order can be important. 
Conveniently, it gives as an example the 
Greek acute accent and smooth breathing mark ("COMMA ABOVE"). 
In this case, since the marks do not stack vertically 
but instead combine horizontally with the breathing mark first, 
the breathing mark must come first in the sequence. 
Thus the first example below is correct, while the second is not:

<p>Combining Three Diacritical Marks in Mozilla</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>That is, it shows the iota subscript, but shows it spaced over to 
the next character position rather than as a subscript. 
</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>So the diacritical marks have been entered in this way, 
and are there in the file; 
they're just invisible. 
</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e420">2.8. Uncommon Diacritical Marks as Precomposed Characters</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e423">2.8.1. Macron</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a> 
Type a hyphen (minus sign) before a letter which can take a macron. 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The macron is also called (or is) the "long" mark. 
A phonetician would probably use a colon suffixed. 
</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e431">2.8.2. Vraxy</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a> 
Type a carat (shift-6) before a letter which can take a vraxy. 

</p> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The greek_utf-8 keymap 
calls this "braxy"; also "breve." 
It's the "short" mark. 
</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e439">2.8.3. Dialytika/Diaeresis</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a> 
The QWERTY colon produces a "diaeresis" 
(double-dot-above, "umlaut"). 
It does so either by itself 
(as U+00A8, "DIAERESIS" from the Unicode range U+0080 to U+00FF, 
"C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement" ("Latin-1 Punctuation")), 
or precombined in the "Greek and Coptic" (not "Greek Extended") range 
(with acute, grave, and modern Greek accents). 

</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e446">2.9. Uncommon Diacritical Marks as Combining Character Sequences</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>(Use the same methods as discussed above for common diacritical marks.) 
</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e452">2.10. Archaic Characters</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<ul> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>stigma: #ST Ϛ</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>sampi: #SP Ϡ</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>digamma: #G Ϝ </li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>qoppa: #Q #q Ϙ ϙ</li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>Note: 
The character which looks like a large letter T with "hands" on the 
ends of its arms 
is "archaic sampi." 
It is not in Unicode. 

</p> 


<h2> 
<a name="d1e467">2.11. Characters Not in the greek_utf-8 keymap</a> 
</h2> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>The keymap does not include 
characters in the ranges: 
</p> 

<ul> 
<a id=""> </a> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Range: U+1DC0 to 1DEF "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement" 
(two dotted accents) 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Range: U+2E00 to U+2E7F "Supplemental Punctuation" 
(ancient Greek textual/editorial symbols) 
</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Range: U+10140 to U+1018F "Ancient Greek Numbers"</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Range: U+1D000 to U+1D0FF "Byzantine Musical Symbols"</li> 

<a id=""> </a> 
<li>Range: U+1D200 to U+1D24F "Ancient Greek Musical Notation"</li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<a id=""> </a>None of the keymaps distributed with vim 6.3 include these. 
I haven't yet written keymaps for them.
